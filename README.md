## Technologies Used

The Next.js Price Tracker leverages a modern tech stack to deliver a robust and scalable solution:

- **Node.js:** The backend is developed using Node.js, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

- **Express.js:** The application uses Express.js as the web framework to handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently.

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database is employed to store product information and user preferences, with Mongoose serving as the ODM.

- **Nodemailer:** For email notifications, Nodemailer is utilized, offering a flexible and powerful solution for sending emails from Node.js applications.

- **Next.js:** The frontend benefits from the features of Next.js, a React framework that facilitates server-side rendering and static site generation.
